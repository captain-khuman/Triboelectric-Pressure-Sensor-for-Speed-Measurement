# Triboelectric-Pressure-Sensor-for-Speed-Measurement

Overview:

The self-powered triboelectric pressure sensor utilizes the unique properties of two triboelectric materials, copper and aluminium, to generate an electric potential when pressure is applied. This potential is harnessed to measure the speed of a moving vehicle passing through the sensor. The system eliminates the need for an external power source, making it self-sustainable and highly portable.


Key Features:

Self-powered operation: The sensor generates electrical energy from the applied pressure, eliminating the need for an external power supply.
Triboelectric materials: Copper and aluminium are employed to efficiently convert mechanical pressure into electrical potential.
Arduino integration: The triboelectric materials are connected to an Arduino board, enabling voltage measurements for accurate speed calculation.
Speed calculation: By measuring the time taken for a vehicle to pass through the sensor, the system calculates the vehicle's speed.
Easy integration: The design and implementation of the self-powered triboelectric pressure sensor offer a user-friendly and straightforward solution.
